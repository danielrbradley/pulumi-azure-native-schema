      Event listener is transparent to Web PubSub clients, and it doesn't return any result to clients nor interrupt the lifetime of clients.\r

      One event can be sent to multiple listeners, as long as it matches the filters in those listeners. The order of the array elements doesn't matter.\r

      Maximum count of event listeners among all hubs is 10."
