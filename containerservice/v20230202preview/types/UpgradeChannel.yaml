type: string
enum:
  - description: Automatically upgrade the cluster to the latest supported patch release on the latest supported minor version. In cases where the cluster is at a version of Kubernetes that is at an N-2 minor version where N is the latest supported minor version, the cluster first upgrades to the latest supported patch version on N-1 minor version. For example, if a cluster is running version 1.17.7 and versions 1.17.9, 1.18.4, 1.18.6, and 1.19.1 are available, your cluster first is upgraded to 1.18.6, then is upgraded to 1.19.1.
    value: rapid
  - description: Automatically upgrade the cluster to the latest supported patch release on minor version N-1, where N is the latest supported minor version. For example, if a cluster is running version 1.17.7 and versions 1.17.9, 1.18.4, 1.18.6, and 1.19.1 are available, your cluster is upgraded to 1.18.6.
    value: stable
  - description: Automatically upgrade the cluster to the latest supported patch version when it becomes available while keeping the minor version the same. For example, if a cluster is running version 1.17.7 and versions 1.17.9, 1.18.4, 1.18.6, and 1.19.1 are available, your cluster is upgraded to 1.17.9.
    value: patch
  - description: Automatically upgrade the node image to the latest version available. Consider using nodeOSUpgradeChannel instead as that allows you to configure node OS patching separate from Kubernetes version patching
    value: node-image
  - description: Disables auto-upgrades and keeps the cluster at its current version of Kubernetes.
    value: none
