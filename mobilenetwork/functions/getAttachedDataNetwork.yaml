        type: string
      description: |-
        The user equipment (UE) address pool prefixes for the attached data network from which the packet core instance will dynamically assign IP addresses to UEs.
        The packet core instance assigns an IP address to a UE when the UE sets up a PDU session.
         You must define at least one of userEquipmentAddressPoolPrefix and userEquipmentStaticAddressPoolPrefix. If you define both, they must be of the same size.
    userEquipmentStaticAddressPoolPrefix:
      type: array
      items:
        type: string

        The packet core instance assigns an IP address to a UE when the UE sets up a PDU session. The static IP address for a specific UE is set in StaticIPConfiguration on the corresponding SIM resource.
        At least one of userEquipmentAddressPoolPrefix and userEquipmentStaticAddressPoolPrefix must be defined. If both are defined, they must be of the same size.
