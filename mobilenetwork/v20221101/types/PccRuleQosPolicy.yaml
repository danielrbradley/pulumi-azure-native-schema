description: Data flow policy rule QoS policy
properties:
  allocationAndRetentionPriorityLevel:
    type: integer
    description: QoS Flow allocation and retention priority (ARP) level. Flows with higher priority preempt flows with lower priority, if the settings of `preemptionCapability` and `preemptionVulnerability` allow it. 1 is the highest level of priority. If this field is not specified then `5qi` is used to derive the ARP value. See 3GPP TS23.501 section 5.7.2.2 for a full description of the ARP parameters.
    default: 9
  fiveQi:
    type: integer
    description: 5G QoS Flow Indicator value. The 5QI identifies a specific QoS forwarding treatment to be provided to a flow. See 3GPP TS23.501 section 5.7.2.1 for a full description of the 5QI parameter, and table 5.7.4-1 for the definition the 5QI values.
    default: 9
  guaranteedBitRate:
    type: object
    $ref: "#/types/azure-native:mobilenetwork/v20221101:Ambr"
    description: The guaranteed bit rate (GBR) for all service data flows that use this data flow policy rule. This is an optional setting. If you do not provide a value, there will be no GBR set for the data flow policy rule that uses this QoS definition.
  maximumBitRate:
    type: object
    $ref: "#/types/azure-native:mobilenetwork/v20221101:Ambr"
    description: The maximum bit rate (MBR) for all service data flows that use this data flow policy rule or service.
  preemptionCapability:
    oneOf:
      - type: string
      - $ref: "#/types/azure-native:mobilenetwork/v20221101:PreemptionCapability"
    description: QoS Flow preemption capability. The preemption capability of a QoS Flow controls whether it can preempt another QoS Flow with a lower priority level. See 3GPP TS23.501 section 5.7.2.2 for a full description of the ARP parameters.
    default: NotPreempt
  preemptionVulnerability:
    oneOf:
      - type: string
      - $ref: "#/types/azure-native:mobilenetwork/v20221101:PreemptionVulnerability"
    description: QoS Flow preemption vulnerability. The preemption vulnerability of a QoS Flow controls whether it can be preempted by a QoS Flow with a higher priority level. See 3GPP TS23.501 section 5.7.2.2 for a full description of the ARP parameters.
    default: Preemptable
