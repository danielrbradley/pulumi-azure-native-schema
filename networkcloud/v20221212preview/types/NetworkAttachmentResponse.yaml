properties:
  attachedNetworkId:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The resource ID of the associated network attached to the virtual machine.
      It can be one of cloudServicesNetwork, l3Network, l2Network or trunkedNetwork resources.
  defaultGateway:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The indicator of whether this is the default gateway.
      Only one of the attached networks (including the CloudServicesNetwork attachment) for a single machine may be specified as True.
  ipAllocationMethod:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The IP allocation mechanism for the virtual machine.
      Dynamic and Static are only valid for l3Network which may also specify Disabled.
      Otherwise, Disabled is the only permitted value.
  ipv4Address:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The IPv4 address of the virtual machine.

      This field is used only if the attached network has IPAllocationType of IPV4 or DualStack.

      If IPAllocationMethod is:
      Static - this field must contain a user specified IPv4 address from within the subnet specified in the attached network.
      Dynamic - this field is read-only, but will be populated with an address from within the subnet specified in the attached network.
      Disabled - this field will be empty.
  ipv6Address:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The IPv6 address of the virtual machine.

      This field is used only if the attached network has IPAllocationType of IPV6 or DualStack.

      If IPAllocationMethod is:
      Static - this field must contain an IPv6 address range from within the range specified in the attached network.
      Dynamic - this field is read-only, but will be populated with an range from within the subnet specified in the attached network.
      Disabled - this field will be empty.
  macAddress:
    type: string
    description: The MAC address of the interface for the virtual machine that corresponds to this network attachment.
  networkAttachmentName:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The associated network's interface name.
      If specified, the network attachment name has a maximum length of 15 characters and must be unique to this virtual machine.
      If the user doesnâ€™t specify this value, the default interface name of the network resource will be used.
      For a CloudServicesNetwork resource, this name will be ignored.
