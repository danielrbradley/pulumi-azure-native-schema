description: |-
  Upon creation, the additional services that are provided by the platform will be allocated and
  represented in the status of this resource. All resources associated with this cloud services network will be part
  of the same layer 2 (L2) isolation domain. At least one service network must be created but may be reused across many
  virtual machines and/or Hybrid AKS clusters.
