description: "TrainingMode mode - Setting to 'auto' is same as setting it to 'non-distributed' for now, however in the future may result in mixed mode or heuristics based mode selection. Default is 'auto'.\r

  If 'Distributed' then only distributed featurization is used and distributed algorithms are chosen.\r

  If 'NonDistributed' then only non distributed algorithms are chosen."
